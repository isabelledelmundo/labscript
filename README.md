# labscript

This program is going to take in inputs of what kind of food, the amount of food, and the frequency of the food being consumed and outputting the micronutrient values.

HOW TO USE:
1. Download Python (preferably 3.6.3, https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/)
2. Scroll all the way down the website to find the downloadable links (should be windows executable installer)
3. Once python is downloaded and installed, download the file in this repository
4. Open up IDLE, and open the labscript.py program
5. Press F5 to run the program, and enter your values!

THINGS TO NOTE:
- Make sure the data.csv file is in the same directory/folder as the labscript.py program, or else it wont work
- If you do not input the food name exactly as in the data.csv file, it will not be able to find the values
- I still need to take care of the unknown values, right now I just have it set to 0
